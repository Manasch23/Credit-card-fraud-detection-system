# Credit Card Fraud detection system

This project is designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It utilizes Random Forest classification and techniques for handling imbalanced datasets, such as Random Under Sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

## Dataset

The dataset used is creditcard.csv, which contains transactions labeled as fraudulent (Class = 1) or legitimate (Class = 0).

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature scaling.

- Imbalanced Data Handling: Using Random Under Sampling (RUS) and SMOTE to balance the dataset.

- Machine Learning Model: Training a Random Forest classifier.

- Evaluation: Generating confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks).

- Implement deep learning-based fraud detection.

- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time fraud detection.
